                                I designed and built a <b>secure Python application</b> that ingests multi-source satellite imagery and uses <b>computer vision</b> plus <b>AI</b> to detect and track signs of <b>military troop movement</b> at global scale. The system supports <b>large GeoTIFF inputs</b> and regional Areas of Interest, enabling analysts to focus on specific theaters while maintaining worldwide coverage.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The pipeline performs robust pre-processing : <b>tiling</b>, <b>denoising</b>, <b>cloud masking</b>, and <b>orthorectification</b>; before running multiple inference stages. Images are normalized and aligned for consistent comparisons across time, sensors, and resolutions, ensuring <b>high-confidence detections</b> in challenging conditions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For analytics, the app combines <b>object detection</b> (vehicles, encampments, logistics assets), <b>change detection</b> (appearance/disappearance, expansion), and <b>temporal tracking</b> to link observations into movement "tracks." It estimates <b>direction</b>, <b>speed</b>, and <b>confidence</b>, correlating repeated sightings to surface likely <b>routes and corridors</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Results are written to a <b>geospatial database (PostGIS)</b> with fast spatial queries and aggregation for <b>heatmaps</b>, AOI boundary crossings, and route clustering. A <b>secured FastAPI</b> layer exposes endpoints for internal dashboards and automated <b>alerting</b> (e.g., notify when ≥N tracked vehicles cross a boundary within 24 hours).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The system scales via <b>containerized workers</b> for batch and near-real-time processing, with <b>Celery</b> task orchestration and <b>Redis</b> queues. It includes <b>audit logging</b>, reproducible runs, and strict <b>data-handling</b> and <b>access controls</b> suitable for sensitive environments. <b>Confidential work, no public demo or code link.</b>

                                I developed <b>QueerView.net</b>, a <b>community-powered web platform</b> where LGBTQIA+

                                demonstrate their commitment to diversity and inclusion. A <b>job board</b> and a <b>blog

                                product data across <b>Google Shopping</b>, <b>marketplace APIs</b>, <b>brand
